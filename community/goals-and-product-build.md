# Goals & Release Targets

We are a community of purpose-driven super-heros, focussed on solving wicked systemic humanitarian and social problems at global scale.  Using evolutionary frontier technology, we are creating the levers to help make this happen.

Isgood.ai is the first product from Solutions for Humanity, and is being developed first; as we need to know what actually works, so we can dedicate resources and efforts towards the initiatives and areas of work that are going to have the greatest positive impact, end-beneficiary outcomes and change.

**Once we have insights from isgood.ai    
-&gt;  then we start work on other solutions, knowing what is good.**

The record of our 2021 Community All-Hands kickoff is in our [Loomio](https://www.loomio.org/d/1c0GpyAr/20210202-feb-isgood-ai-all-hands).
